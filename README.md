471 AI Project

To run simply open the minesweeper.html file in whatever your browser of preference may be and press the Run AI button in the top right. One can also click the board and the AI will automatically run as well. The AI will run 10 iterations on every click, to continue just push the run AI button again, if no changes it is likely stuck. The user can select a different complexity of the board via the Game button as well as alter some other options in the Display button. Lastly there is a button that displays the controls aptly named Controls however, note that this does not account for the AI that will automatically run upon a move selection by the user.

ai.js contains the code for the ai
extra.js is testing for gaussian elimination code
